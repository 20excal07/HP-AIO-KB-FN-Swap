# FN function swap for HP Pavillion All-In-One keyboards
Swaps the functionality of the FN key on [HP Pavillion All-In-One keyboards.](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/182403i5A17A64A69599A3E?v=v2)

Made with AutoHotkey v2.

A few motes:
- The function keys can get "sticky" when multiple function keys are pressed. Try to press just one at a time.
  - I tried my best to mitigate it, but it's not perfect and they can still get "stuck" if you press multiple.
- I don't know how to map the "Brightness Up/Down" (F7/F8) keys because it's not a key that AHK recognises.
  - Instead, you can press the Calculator/Show Desktop shortcut keys on the numpad to get F7 and F8.
  - Otherwise, the original F7 and F8 keys work as-is and you'd need to hold down the Fn key to get them.
